# odin-library

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate familiarity with Javascript's prototypical Object Oriented Programming style, by creating a library of Book objects which get added to the library depending on user input.

Another aspect of this project is that it is a good refresher for practicing CSS Grid, and a demonstration of DOM manipulation skills.
The first part of the project will involve working on the UI solely, hence why none of the buttons will be interactive, and the library will have pre-existing books. 
The next phase would be the coding phase, where the necessary Javascript code will be written to add functionality to the webpage. 
The last phase is another touch on the UI to connect the script with the HTML document, and to clean up any of the pre-existing books.
